==========
How do I know the markdown file displaying correctly in webstorm?
To solve this webstorm has many plugins.

## Search which plugin you want.

1. Go to JetBrains plugin page. <code>[<u>Wobstorm plugins</u>](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/webStorm/, "Webstorm plugin searching")</code>
2. Search <code>markdown</code>.
3. Their are many plugins for using markdown in webstorm. See the results and select one of them. I choose <code>[<u>gfm</u>](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7701?pr=webStorm)</code>.
Because I just want to learn markdown grammar a little easier. the plugin seems to be quite simple.

## Install the plugin.
1. Open your webstorm.
2. Find plugin setting.
<code>File > Setting > Plugin</code>
3. You have to searching the plugin installed already.
If the result is nothing, you click the button <code>Install JetBrains Plugin...</code> or  <code>Browse repositories...</code> and search again.
